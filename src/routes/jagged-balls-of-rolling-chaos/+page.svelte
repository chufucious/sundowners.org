            Also, if you're bringing a generator; make sure to bring secondary
            containment for your gas. Bonus points: bring a lock with cable, as
            they're known to wander off (especially during exodus).

            RE generator security - we're mostly making it inconvenient to
            snatch & run. So we can either lock our pack of generators to each
            other with a long cable, or go pro - loop the end of some rebar,
            hammer that into the ground, and secure the whole blob to that as
            extra security. (Baffle boxes are a good sound dampening & potential
            security option, but that's probably a project for another day,
            unless someone is feeling feisty.)
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> ideally use the same code (resettable combo locks,
            if multiple) so anyone can move the generators if necessary

            Yeah, ice/Gatorade & shade for strike and a crash tent (with AC) so
            Monday strikers can enjoy the sunset on playa then sleep until
            Tuesday when the line dies down.

            <li>
              If it's raining, do not leave town until you're sure the gate is
              open. They have and will stop traffic for as long as it takes for
              the playa to dry. While our crew personally enjoyed waiting 12
              hours on the road, peeing behind rocks, it is not ideal.
            </li>
            <li>
              If it's dry, you might see a bit more traffic, since other crews
              may have delayed entry.
            </li>
            <li>
              For those who haven't seen rain on playa, don't expect to easily
              walk or bike while traffic is shut down. The mud cakes up and
              sticks to wheels and feet.
            </li>

              Oh, and if anyone is going in early, a wet generator is a sad

            <strong>Star brite snap & zipper lubricant:</strong> helps with dusty
            zippers (boots & tents, etc). it's all fun and drugs until your zipper
            gets stuck closed in a porta potty on chili friday.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Gaffer tape</strong> - a great alternative to duct tape bc it
            handles heat better and leaves little or no residue/damage.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Burner problem:</strong> bike light batteries don't last
            long enough and the bike lights are often üí© <strong>Hack:</strong> get
            a flashlight strap. This allows you to use a superior flashlight that's
            multi use. I've battle tested this one. Long lasting, bright light, and
            best of all : hybrid rechargeable that ALSO takes ready available AA
            batteries. Pack accordingly, and you can ride bright all night.

          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-4">

              PS: Art car spotters - this triples as a spotlight you can use to
              light up dark wads for the driver. Also handy for hippy macing
              anyone in the eyes that isn't paying attention.
            </li>
            <li>
              PSS: TAKE the light with you when you park. Quality flashlights DO
              get stolen.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Also - dry bike lube only.</strong> Not the wet stuff. It's the
            chunky peanut butter of bad decisions. Works on stuck zippers in a pinch.
            Nice for tents, a goddamn life saver if it's your pants.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Also - as a sundowner,</strong> the chances of blinding yourself
            during a psychedelic ceremony are not zero. Bring eye drops. #worthit
            They're also good for washing wind blown bogies out of your eye. The
            single packs are easy to carry. Pair with a tiny mirror and tissue paper
            (since you don't want to touch your eye with dirty hands - if eyedrops
            fail to the trick, gunk will usually stick to the corner of a tissue
            applied very gently - wait, watch - lift out).
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Had a tough time in exodus traffic?</strong> Realized you have
            to pee and can't find the portos? This isn't the worst thing to have
            in your backpack, friends. Since we're responsible for everything that
            hits the playa - these are a solid companion for drinkers (and art cars
            - I'll chuck a few in my bag for Rexan).
