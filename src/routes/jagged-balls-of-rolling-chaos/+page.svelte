          RE generator security - we're mostly making it inconvenient to snatch
          & run. So we can either lock our pack of generators to each other with
          a long cable, or go pro - loop the end of some rebar, hammer that into
          the ground, and secure the whole blob to that as extra security.
          (Baffle boxes are a good sound dampening & potential security option,
          but that's probably a project for another day, unless someone is
          feeling feisty.) Note: ideally use the same code (resettable combo
          locks, if multiple) so anyone can move the generators if necessary

          The public ESD email address 911@burningman.com is a way for the

          Yeah, ice/Gatorade & shade for strike and a crash tent (with AC) so
          Monday strikers can enjoy the sunset on playa then sleep until Tuesday
          when the line dies down.

          If it's raining, do not leave town until you're sure the gate is open.
          They have and will stop traffic for as long as it takes for the playa
          to dry. While our crew personally enjoyed waiting 12 hours on the
          road, peeing behind rocks, it is not ideal.
        </li>
        <li>
          If it's dry, you might see a bit more traffic, since other crews may
          have delayed entry.
        </li>
        <li>
          For those who haven't seen rain on playa, don't expect to easily walk
          or bike while traffic is shut down. The mud cakes up and sticks to
          wheels and feet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Oh, and if anyone is going in early, a wet generator is a sad
          generator - no touchie.

          Star brite snap & zipper lubricant: helps with dusty zippers (boots &
          tents, etc). it's all fun and drugs until your zipper gets stuck
          closed in a porta potty on chili friday.
        </li>
        <li>
          dry bike lube only. Not the wet stuff. It's the chunky peanut butter
          of bad decisions. Works on stuck zippers in a pinch. Nice for tents, a
          goddamn life saver if it's your pants.
        </li>
        <li>
          gaffer tape - a great alternative to duct tape bc it handles heat
          better and leaves little or no residue/damage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Also - as a sundowner, the chances of blinding yourself during a
          psychedelic ceremony are not zero. Bring eye drops. #worthit They're
          also good for washing wind blown bogies out of your eye. The single
          packs are easy to carry. Pair with a tiny mirror and tissue paper
          (since you don't want to touch your eye with dirty hands - if eyedrops
          fail to the trick, gunk will usually stick to the corner of a tissue
          applied very gently - wait, watch - lift out).

          Had a tough time in exodus traffic? Realized you have to pee and can't
          find the portos? This isn't the worst thing to have in your backpack,
          friends. Since we're responsible for everything that hits the playa -
          these are a solid companion for drinkers (and art cars - I'll chuck a
          few in my bag for Rexan).
        </li>
        <li>
          Burner problem: bike light batteries don't last long enough and the
          bike lights are often ðŸ’© Hack: get a flashlight strap. This allows you
          to use a superior flashlight that's multi use. I've battle tested this
          one. Long lasting, bright light, and best of all : hybrid rechargeable
          that ALSO takes ready available AA batteries. Pack accordingly, and
          you can ride bright all night.

              PS: Art car spotters - this triples as a spotlight you can use to
              light up dark wads for the driver. Also handy for hippy macing
              anyone in the eyes that isn't paying attention.
            </li>
            <li>
              PSS: TAKE the light with you when you park. Quality flashlights DO
              get stolen.

          12" stakes & rebar (candy cane the ends to prevent injury) are what it
          takes to secure a tent against playa winds
