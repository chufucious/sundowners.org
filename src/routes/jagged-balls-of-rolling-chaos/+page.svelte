        RE generator security - we're mostly making it inconvenient to snatch &
        run. So we can either lock our pack of generators to each other with a
        long cable, or go pro - loop the end of some rebar, hammer that into the
        ground, and secure the whole blob to that as extra security. (Baffle
        boxes are a good sound dampening & potential security option, but that's
        probably a project for another day, unless someone is feeling feisty.)
        Note: ideally use the same code (resettable combo locks, if multiple) so
        anyone can move the generators if necessary

        If it's raining, do not leave town until you're sure the gate is open.
        They have and will stop traffic for as long as it takes for the playa to
        dry. While our crew personally enjoyed waiting 12 hours on the road,
        peeing behind rocks, it is not ideal.
      </li>
      <li>
        If it's dry, you might see a bit more traffic, since other crews may
        have delayed entry.
      </li>
      <li>
        For those who haven't seen rain on playa, don't expect to easily walk or
        bike while traffic is shut down. The mud cakes up and sticks to wheels
        and feet.

        Star brite snap & zipper lubricant: helps with dusty zippers (boots &
        tents, etc). it's all fun and drugs until your zipper gets stuck closed
        in a porta potty on chili friday.

      <li>
        dry bike lube only. Not the wet stuff. It's the chunky peanut butter of
        bad decisions. Works on stuck zippers in a pinch. Nice for tents, a
        goddamn life saver if it's your pants.
      </li>
      <li>
        gaffer tape - a great alternative to duct tape bc it handles heat better
        and leaves little or no residue/damage.

        Also - as a sundowner, the chances of blinding yourself during a
        psychedelic ceremony are not zero. Bring eye drops. #worthit They're
        also good for washing wind blown bogies out of your eye. The single
        packs are easy to carry. Pair with a tiny mirror and tissue paper (since
        you don't want to touch your eye with dirty hands - if eyedrops fail to
        the trick, gunk will usually stick to the corner of a tissue applied
        very gently - wait, watch - lift out).

        Had a tough time in exodus traffic? Realized you have to pee and can't
        find the portos? This isn't the worst thing to have in your backpack,
        friends. Since we're responsible for everything that hits the playa -
        these are a solid companion for drinkers (and art cars - I'll chuck a
        few in my bag for Rexan).
      </li>

        Burner problem: bike light batteries don't last long enough and the bike
        lights are often ðŸ’© Hack: get a flashlight strap. This allows you to use
        a superior flashlight that's multi use. I've battle tested this one.
        Long lasting, bright light, and best of all : hybrid rechargeable that
        ALSO takes ready available AA batteries. Pack accordingly, and you can
        ride bright all night.

            PS: Art car spotters - this triples as a spotlight you can use to
            light up dark wads for the driver. Also handy for hippy macing
            anyone in the eyes that isn't paying attention.
          </li>
          <li>
            PSS: TAKE the light with you when you park. Quality flashlights DO
            get stolen.

        12" stakes & rebar (candy cane the ends to prevent injury) are what it
        takes to secure a tent against playa winds
